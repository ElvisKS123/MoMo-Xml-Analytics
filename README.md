## MoMo Xml Analytics

## 📝 Project Description

This project is an enterprise-level fullstack application that processes MoMo SMS data in XML format, cleans and categorizes transactions, stores them in a relational database (SQLite), and provides a frontend dashboard to analyze and visualize the data.

The system will include:

ETL pipeline (extract, clean, normalize, categorize)

SQLite database for storage

JSON exports for the dashboard

Frontend interface (charts + tables)

Through this project, we will demonstrate our team’s capacity to process and structure raw data, build reliable database systems, and create meaningful visualizations for end users.
